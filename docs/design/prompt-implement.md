Write a comprehensive and highly-detailed design specification for v0.7.5j. Do not make up new features or functionality, but rather rely upon those outlined in the version scope breakdowns (e.g.,@v0.5.1-terminal-foundation.md), previous design specifications (e.g.,@v0.6.1e-json-schema-system.md), changelogs, and so on.
